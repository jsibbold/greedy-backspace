Greedy Backspace

This extension is about as basic as it gets. This is a stronger version of some of the other Hungry Backspace extensions. It eats up any whitespace, INCLUDING newline characters, until it encounters a non-whitespace character. This is closer to the functionality seen in Intellij editors.
